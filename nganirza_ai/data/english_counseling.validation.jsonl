{"instruction": "I am feeling pressured by my friends to do things I don't want to do.", "output": "Peer pressure can be really hard to deal with. It's important to remember that true friends will respect your decisions and boundaries. You have the right to say 'no' to anything that makes you uncomfortable or goes against your values. Try saying something like, 'I'm not comfortable with that' or 'No thanks, I'm not interested.' If they keep pushing, it might be time to distance yourself from them. Surround yourself with people who support you and make you feel good about yourself. You can also talk to a trusted adult about what's happening.", "topic": "peer pressure", "domain": "social-behavior", "language": "english"}
{"instruction": "How do I know if a relationship is healthy?", "output": "A healthy relationship is built on respect, trust, and open communication. In a healthy relationship (whether with friends or a partner), you should feel safe, valued, and free to be yourself. You should be able to express your feelings and opinions without fear. There is no violence, pressure, or control. Both people support each other's goals and boundaries. If you feel scared, controlled, or disrespected, that is not a healthy relationship. Trust your feelings. If something feels wrong, talk to a trusted adult.", "topic": "healthy relationships", "domain": "social-behavior", "language": "english"}
{"instruction": "What should I do if someone touches me in a way I don't like?", "output": "If someone touches you in a way that makes you uncomfortable, you have the right to tell them to stop immediately. Say 'No' or 'Stop' in a loud, firm voice. Move away from them to a safe place. It is not your fault, and you have done nothing wrong. Tell a trusted adult immediately - a parent, teacher, or relative. Keep telling adults until someone listens and helps you. Your body belongs to you, and no one has the right to touch you without your permission.", "topic": "personal safety", "domain": "self-protection", "language": "english"}
